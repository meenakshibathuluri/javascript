Variables:
A variable is like a container that holds data that can be reused or updated later in the program. 
In JavaScript, variables are declared using the keywords var, let, or const.

1. var Keyword:
The var keyword is used to declare a variable. It has a function-scoped or globally-scoped behaviour.
example:
var n = 5;
console.log(n);
var n = 20; // reassigning is allowed
console.log(n);
Output:
5
20

2. let Keyword:
The let keyword is introduced in ES6, has block scope and cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
example:
let  n= 10;
n = 20; // Value can be updated
// let n = 15; //can not redeclare
console.log(n)

3.const Keyword:
The const keyword declares variables that cannot be reassigned. It's block-scoped as well.
example:
const n = 100;
// n = 200; This will throw an error
console.log(n)
