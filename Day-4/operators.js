/*Operators:

       JavaScript operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables. 
       They are the building blocks of JavaScript expressions and can manipulate data in various ways.

1. JavaScript Arithmetic Operators:

Arithmetic Operators perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

const sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
const diff = 10 - 2; // Subtraction
const p = 4 * 2; // Multiplication
const q = 8 / 2; // Division
console.log(sum, diff, p, q);

Output:
8 8 8 4

+ adds two numbers.
- subtracts the second number from the first.
* multiplies two numbers.
/ divides the first number by the second.

2. JavaScript Assignment Operators:

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform operations like addition or multiplication while assigning the value.


let n = 10;
n += 5;
n *= 2;
console.log(n);

Output
30

= assigns a value to a variable.
+= adds and assigns the result to the variable.
*= multiplies and assigns the result to the variable.


3. JavaScript Comparison Operators:

Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean (true or false). They are useful for making decisions in conditional statements.


console.log(10 > 5);
console.log(10 === "10");

Output
true
false

> checks if the left value is greater than the right.
=== checks for strict equality (both type and value).
Other operators include <, <=, >=, and !==.


4. JavaScript Logical Operators:

Logical operators are mainly used to perform the logical operations that determine the equality or difference between the values.


const a = true, b = false;
console.log(a && b); // Logical AND
console.log(a || b); // Logical OR

Output:

false
true

&& returns true if both operands are true.
|| returns true if at least one operand is true.
! negates the boolean value.

5. JavaScript Bitwise Operators:

Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.

const res = 5 & 1; // Bitwise AND
console.log(res);

Output
1
& performs a bitwise AND.
| performs a bitwise OR.
^ performs a bitwise XOR.
~ performs a bitwise NOT.


6. JavaScript Unary Operators:

Unary operators operate on a single operand (e.g., increment, decrement).


let x = 5;
console.log(++x); // Pre-increment
console.log(x--); // Post-decrement (Output: 6, then x becomes 5)

Output
6
6

++ increments the value by 1.
-- decrements the value by 1.
typeof returns the type of a variable.*/
